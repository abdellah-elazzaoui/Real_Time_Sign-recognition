# Real_Time_Sign-recognition
I built a real-time hand sign recognition system using OpenCV, MediaPipe, and a custom-trained machine learning model. It captures webcam input, detects hand landmarks, extracts features, and predicts ASL letters like A, B, and L. The system displays predictions live, combining CV and ML in a smooth application.
